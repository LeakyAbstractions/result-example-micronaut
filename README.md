# Example Micronaut Application Using Results

This is a simple implementation of a [Petstore][PET_STORE] server powered by [Micronaut][MICRONAUT].

The purpose of this example application is to demonstrate how to make use of [Result][RESULT_LIBRARY] libraries in
projects based on Spring Boot. For the sake of brevity, the Petstore spec is implemented partially.


## Getting Started

Build and run the application.

```shell
./gradlew run
```

This will start a stand-alone server on port 8080.


## Testing the Server

Once started, you can interact with the API.

```shell
curl -s -H 'x-type: local' http://localhost:8080/pet/0
```

You should see a JSON response like this:

```json
{"version":"1.0","result":{"success":{"id":0,"name":"Rocky","status":"AVAILABLE"}}}
```


## Using Swagger-UI

You can navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> to inspect the API using an interactive UI.
